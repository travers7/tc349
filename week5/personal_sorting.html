		<h1>Card Sorting my personal Website Idea</h1>
		<h2 style="text-align:center;margin:5px;">Findings</h2>
		<p>I've always wated a personal site that would be my business card, but more than a card, it would have large amount of persoanl work examples, pictures, resume etc. I think having a well polished website that can show off my personal skills and ability to use the latest web technologies would be very benificial to me.</p>

		<p>
			This site is a rather generic 'personal' site with links to example work and resume with links to social media and a bio. I think that the way it is organized is simple but simple works for sites like these, people use them for very few reasons other than to find information about you and don't want to spend too much time looking for it. The simple desisng facilitates this use in the best way passible. <br /> some reviewer thought that a personal blog would also fit quite well in the site. I agree with this, howe ver, I don't know how much I would actually use this feature. It would be easy to add in the future, so I would focus on the core functionality as we have shon above before I focused on a blog aspect of the site.<br/>
