		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorting that was chosen differs from the NASA Earth's Moon website in many ways; however, keep in <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;mind that this is the result of multiple people's sorting combined into one agreeable final sort. The names of <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the links on the left toolbar did not change, but the content within the links did change and/or were moved <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;around. Both the sorters and I agreed that subjects such as opportunities for working alongside NASA and &nbsp;&nbsp;NASA's partners should be combined because of the similarities of becoming/already being affiliated with <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;this organization. The other changes were made because they added more basic simplicity to the organization <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;of the content on the website. It was difficult to arrange the information and content of this website because <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;none of us were familiar with any detailed facts or the deep history of our planet's moon.
