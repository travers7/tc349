		<p>
			The sorting that was chosen differs from the NASA Earth's Moon website in many ways; however, keep in mind that this is the result of multiple people's oppinion of the sorting combined into an agreeable final sort. The names of the links on the left toolbar did not change, but the content within the links did change and/or move around. Both the sorters and myself agreed that subjects such as opportunities for working along side NASA and NASA's parterns should be combined because of the similiarities of becoming/already being affiliated with this organization. The other changes were agreed that they added more basic simplicity to the to the organization of the content to the website. It was difficult to arrange the information and content of this website because none of us were familiar with any detailed facts or the deep history of our planet's moon.
