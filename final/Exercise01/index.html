		<h2 style="text-align: left; text-decoration: underline;">My Background</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an extremely big country music fan and it is by far my favorite genre of music. &nbsp;Some of my favorite country artists &nbsp;&nbsp;include: George Strait, Zac Brown Band, Jake Owen, Brad Paisley, Dierks Bentley, Billy Currington, and many more. &nbsp;I <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;have been a fan of country music for as long as I can remember and I doubt I'll ever stop listening to this genre. &nbsp;I find that <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I can relate to the lyrics in country music more than any other genre of music, i.e. Rap, because of the type of town <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson City, MI is. &nbsp;My passion for country music is the reason that I am creating this website. &nbsp;There are countless other &nbsp;&nbsp;genres of music that have websites which allow its users access to a constantly updated list of Top 100 songs, New &nbsp;&nbsp;Songs, Music Videos, etc. &nbsp;I would like to create a flawless website that does all of those things for country music.</p>
		<h2 style="text-align: left; text-decoration: underline;">My Website</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to create a website called www.CountryAllDay.com which will feature all of those catagories that I mentioned &nbsp;&nbsp;above. &nbsp;My website will allow it's users to browse the current Top 100 country songs/albums, the most &nbsp;&nbsp;popular/latest/upcoming New Songs the day they are released to the public and the most popular and latest Music Videos. &nbsp;&nbsp;When users create an account, they will have the option to pay a contract-free monthly fee to have unlimited music and &nbsp;&nbsp;video download access to all of the website's content; however, users can share music content on the website to others <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;at no charge. &nbsp;Users will also have the option to create a list of their favorite country artists so as soon as a user's favorite &nbsp;&nbsp;artists on the list releases a new song, album or music video, they will receieve a notification next time they sign into their &nbsp;&nbsp;account. &nbsp;There will also be an free option for the user to receieve an e-mail or text message updating them that they can &nbsp;&nbsp;instantly access the new music released.</p>
